# Part 5: Providing Project Ideas (1 points)
#
# * Objective:
#   Provide draft project ideas in order to form teams.
# * Details:
#   * This part ensures student start putting time to brainstorm their
#     (mid-term) projects.
#   * Your submission should include three project ideas based on the
#     topics that are covered in the first half of this course:
#     * Data Representation and Errors
#     * Numerical Linear Algebra
#     * Fourier Transform and Spectral Analysis
#     * Interpolation and Extrapolation
#     * Numerical and Automatic Derivatives
#     * Numerical Integration of Functions
#     * Root Finding and Optimization Methods
#     * ODE Integrators
#     * PDE Solvers
#   * You submission will be a well formatted YAML file `hw1/p5.yaml`.
#
# About YAML:
# * YAML (short for "YAML Ain't Markup Language") is a human-readable
#   format for data storage and configuration.
# * YAML uses Python-style indentation for nesting and avoids the use
#   of extraneous characters, making it easy to read.
# * Comments in YAML start with `#` and continue until the end of the line.
#
# Submission Requirement:
# * Your submission must be a valid YAML file that can be read by Python.
# * It should contain a list of three dictionaries, each with the following keys:
#   * "topic": Choose one of the topics listed above.
#   * "idea": Provide a short, clear, and concise description of your project idea.
#
# Below is a sample project idea.

# TODO: Edit this sample idea.

- topic: Fourier Transform and Spectral Analysis
  idea:  Using spectral analysis and decomposition to characterize the 
        large- and fine-scale convection in solar data from SOHO and SDO.

# TODO: Add two more project ideas below, following the same format as
# the example above.
# Remember to ensure that each idea is distinct and concise, and each
# "topic" must be one of the listed course topics.

- topic: ODE Integrators
  idea: Simulating a simple 2D model of a shear layer in a rotating star 
        to model the Kevin Helmholtz instability, with the possible addition of 
        a simple nuclear reaction network to investigate nucleosynthesis.

- topic: PDE Solvers
  idea: Solving a simplified model of heat/thermal diffusion for an 
        accretion disk.
